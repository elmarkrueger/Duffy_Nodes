> [!WARNING]
> **Manual Installation Required for GGUF Multimodal Analyzer Node**
>
> The **Gemma-4 GGUF Multimodal Analyzer** node requires **llama-cpp-python v0.3.36 or higher**, because the Gemma 4 chat template was not integrated until that version. The current official release on PyPI is only **v0.3.20-cu123**, which **will not work**.
>
> You must manually install a pre-built wheel from the community repository:
> **https://github.com/JamePeng/llama-cpp-python/releases** (v0.3.36 for various CUDA versions is available).
>
> `llama-cpp-python` is **not** included in `requirements.txt` and will not be installed automatically.
>
> See **[docs/llm_node_setup.md](docs/llm_node_setup.md)** for detailed installation instructions, including how to install the wheel into ComfyUI's `python_embedded` environment.

> [!TIP]
> **Modern UI Integration:** Several nodes in this pack feature advanced **Vue 3** interactive interfaces for a superior user experience. These frontend components are **precompiled** into the `web/js` directory. Users do not need to install Node.js, Vite, or any build tools to use this pack; it works immediately upon installation like any other ComfyUI extension.

#### � Seed
![Duffy Seed](images/seed.jpg)
*Category: `Duffy/utilities`*

Advanced seed node with randomize, increment, decrement, and fixed modes. Handles seed generation on the frontend before the prompt is sent to the server, ensuring reproducibility and proper metadata embedding. Includes a server-side fallback for direct API usage.

**Inputs:** `seed` (INT, range ±1,125,899,906,842,624)  
**Outputs:** `SEED` (INT)

**Features:**
- 🎲 **Randomize Each Time** — generates a new random seed on every queue (seed = -1)

- 📡 **Frontend prompt interception** — replaces special seed values in the serialized prompt and workflow metadata before they reach the server, avoiding caching issues
- 🛡️ **Server-side API fallback** — when special seeds arrive via direct API calls (no frontend), the backend generates a random seed and persists it to workflow & prompt metadata
- 📋 **Context menu** with quick actions and toggleable "Last Seed" display widget
- 🧩 Removes the default ComfyUI `control_after_generate` dropdown in favor of dedicated buttons

## 🏗️ Architecture

This node pack is built with **ComfyUI Nodes 2.0** and **Schema V3** standards:

✅ **Stateless Design** - All nodes use `@classmethod` methods, no instance variables  
✅ **Declarative Schema** - Inputs/outputs defined via `define_schema()` with typed `io` objects  
✅ **Proper Caching** - Implements `fingerprint_inputs()` for intelligent cache invalidation  
✅ **Vue-Compatible UI** - Custom widgets use `getCustomWidgets()` API with pointer event capture  
✅ **Type Safety** - Full type hints and proper tensor dimension handling  
✅ **Zero Side Effects** - Pure functions with predictable behavior
